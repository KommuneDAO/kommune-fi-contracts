# CLAUDE.md - Project-Specific Instructions for KommuneFi Contracts

## üö® MANDATORY FIRST STEPS - ALWAYS READ THIS üö®

**Before implementing ANY new feature or fixing ANY issue:**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Deposit Function Usage (2025-08-15)

**NEVER confuse these two deposit functions:**

1. **`deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver)`** - WKAIA ONLY
   - Requires user to ALREADY have WKAIA
   - Requires WKAIA approve() to ShareVault first
   - DO NOT send native KAIA as msg.value
   ```javascript
   // WRONG ‚ùå
   await shareVault.deposit(amount, user, {value: amount})  // WILL FAIL!
   
   // CORRECT ‚úÖ
   await wkaia.deposit({value: amount})  // First wrap KAIA to WKAIA
   await wkaia.approve(shareVault, amount)  // Then approve
   await shareVault.deposit(amount, user)  // Finally deposit
   ```

2. **`depositKAIA(address receiver)`** - NATIVE KAIA
   - For direct native KAIA deposits
   - NO approve needed
   - Send KAIA as msg.value
   ```javascript
   // CORRECT ‚úÖ
   await shareVault.depositKAIA(user, {value: amount})
   ```

**Common Mistake**: Using `deposit()` with `{value: amount}` - This ALWAYS fails because deposit() expects WKAIA, not native KAIA!

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED CHECKLIST:
1. **üìñ Read existing successful implementations FIRST**:
   - `src/KommuneVaultV2.sol` - Reference for all swap logic, withdrawal patterns, LST handling
   - `src/SwapContract.sol` - FINALIZED, do not modify, reference for swap patterns
   - Previous working scripts in `scripts/tests/`

2. **üîç Search for existing solutions**:
   - Check if the problem was already solved in KommuneVaultV2.sol
   - Look for similar patterns in working contracts
   - Compare with previous successful implementations

3. **üìã Document before coding**:
   - What existing pattern will you copy?
   - Why is this pattern proven to work?
   - What specific lines from working contracts are you referencing?

4. **‚ùå DO NOT assume or reimplement from scratch**:
   - Don't guess at swap logic - copy from KommuneVaultV2.sol
   - Don't reinvent LST handling - use proven patterns
   - Don't ignore documented issues - follow established solutions

### üéØ Key Reference Contracts:
- **KommuneVaultV2.sol**: Multi-LST swaps, withdrawal logic, slippage handling, stKAIA processing
- **SwapContract.sol**: GIVEN_OUT swaps, token sorting, balance verification
- **Previous test scripts**: Proven test patterns and scenarios

**Violation of this checklist leads to repeated mistakes and wasted time.**

## üìö Historical Issues Reference

For detailed historical issues and their resolutions, see **[CLAUDE_HISTORY.md](./CLAUDE_HISTORY.md)**

Key resolved issues include:
- queryBatchSwap smart contract limitations
- Multi-LST sequential swap patterns  
- Withdrawal threshold calculations
- WKAIA deposit state sync fixes
- ClaimManager storage layout
- LP token valuation
- Contract upgrade cache issues

## Critical Instructions

### Script Organization Rules

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Test Script Management**

1. **Always create new test scripts in `scripts/temp/` folder first**
   - All new test scripts must be created in `scripts/temp/`
   - Only move to `scripts/` when explicitly instructed to keep/save
   - This keeps the project organized and makes cleanup easier

2. **Script Folder Structure:**
   - `scripts/` - Main scripts that are confirmed and kept
   - `scripts/temp/` - Temporary test scripts (can be cleaned up later)
   - `scripts/tests/` - Additional test scripts for specific components

3. **When creating new test scripts:**
   ```
   // WRONG
   scripts/newTestScript.js
   
   // CORRECT
   scripts/temp/newTestScript.js
   ```

### SwapContract.sol - FINALIZED (DO NOT MODIFY)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: SwapContract.sol has been finalized and thoroughly tested. DO NOT modify this file under any circumstances.**

#### Status: ‚úÖ FINALIZED on 2025-08-14 (Asset recovery functions added 2025-08-25)

The SwapContract has been:
- Fully tested with all 4 LSTs (wKoKAIA, wGCKAIA, wstKLAY, stKAIA)
- Optimized to use unified sorting logic for all tokens
- Successfully performs GIVEN_OUT swaps for precise WKAIA output amounts
- Integrated with Balancer V2 pools on Kairos testnet
- Asset recovery functions added for stranded tokens

#### DO NOT:
- ‚ùå Modify any function in SwapContract.sol
- ‚ùå Question the token sorting logic (it's been thoroughly tested)
- ‚ùå Change pool IDs or token addresses
- ‚ùå Alter the GIVEN_OUT swap implementation

## Key Concepts

### stKAIA Rate Provider Application (Fixed 2025-09-03)

**‚úÖ FIXED: Direct stKAIA holdings now correctly apply rate provider (1.0589x)**

#### Background:
- stKAIA is a rebasing token where 1 stKAIA > 1 KAIA due to accumulated staking rewards
- Rate provider at 0xefBDe60d5402a570DF7CA0d26Ddfedc413260146 provides the conversion rate
- Other LSTs (wKoKAIA, wGCKAIA, wstKLAY) use unwrapping functions for conversion

#### The Fix:
VaultCore now applies the rate provider when calculating totalAssets for direct stKAIA holdings (index 3).

### Important: Understanding Shares vs WKAIA

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Users care about WKAIA amounts, not shares**

#### Key Concepts:
- **Shares**: Internal accounting tokens representing ownership percentage in the vault
- **WKAIA**: Actual wrapped KAIA tokens that users can withdraw and use
- **maxWithdraw**: Returns the maximum amount of **WKAIA** (not shares!) that can be withdrawn
- **balanceOf**: Returns the amount of **shares** (not WKAIA!) owned by the user

#### Correct Approach for Withdrawals:
```javascript
// WRONG - using shares
const shares = await shareVault.balanceOf(user);
const withdrawShares = shares / 2n; // 50% of shares
await shareVault.redeem(withdrawShares, user, user);

// CORRECT - using WKAIA amounts
const maxWKAIA = await shareVault.maxWithdraw(user); // This is WKAIA amount!
const withdrawWKAIA = maxWKAIA / 2n; // 50% of withdrawable WKAIA
await shareVault.withdraw(withdrawWKAIA, user, user);
```

## Current Architecture: Separated Vault (V2)

### Core Contracts
- `src/ShareVault.sol` - ERC-4626 share management (12.23 KB)
- `src/VaultCore.sol` - Asset management logic with LP support (~20 KB)
- `src/SwapContract.sol` - ‚úÖ FINALIZED - Handles Balancer swaps (9.26 KB)
- `src/ClaimManager.sol` - Handles unstake/claim operations via delegatecall

## Development Guidelines

### When Working on This Project:
1. **Use V2 Architecture** - ShareVault + VaultCore (separated)
2. **Never modify SwapContract.sol** - It's finalized and tested
3. **Test scripts are in `scripts/tests/` directory**
4. **ALWAYS use deployment files for addresses** - Never hardcode addresses
   - Kairos testnet: `deployments-stable-kairos.json`, `deployments-balanced-kairos.json`
   - Kaia mainnet: `deployments-stable-kaia.json`, `deployments-balanced-kaia.json`
   - These files are the source of truth for all contract addresses

### Getting Contract Addresses:
```javascript
// Always read from deployment files
const deployments = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(`deployments-${profile}-${network}.json`, 'utf8'));
const shareVault = deployments.shareVault;
const vaultCore = deployments.vaultCore;
// etc...
```

### Sending Rewards to VaultCore:
Use `scripts/sendWKAIAtoVaultCores.js` to send WKAIA rewards:
```bash
# Send 0.5 WKAIA to each VaultCore (default)
npx hardhat run scripts/sendWKAIAtoVaultCores.js --network kaia
npx hardhat run scripts/sendWKAIAtoVaultCores.js --network kairos

# Send custom amount
SEND_AMOUNT=1 npx hardhat run scripts/sendWKAIAtoVaultCores.js --network kaia
```
This increases totalAssets for all depositors proportionally.

### Investment Profile Ratios Explained:
- **investRatio**: Percentage of total WKAIA to convert to LSTs (e.g., 100%)
- **balancedRatio**: Percentage of LSTs to add to LP pools (e.g., 50%)
- **Example**: With investRatio=100% and balancedRatio=50%:
  - 0% remains as WKAIA liquidity buffer
  - 50% becomes LST and stays as LST (100% √ó 50%)
  - 50% becomes LST then goes to LP pools (100% √ó 50%)

## Recent Updates

### LP Query Tools Added (2025-09-03)

**New utility scripts for LP token analysis:**
- **`scripts/queryLPExit.js`** - Query single-token exit values from Balancer pools
  - Supports custom LP amounts and specific token exits
  - Calculates unwrapped KAIA values with rate providers
- **`scripts/queryBPTSwap.js`** - Query BPT‚ÜíWKAIA swap rates through dedicated pool
  - Alternative to proportional exits for Composable Stable Pools
  - Provides market-based pricing

See [README.md](./README.md#lp-token-valuation-tools) for detailed usage instructions.

### stKAIA Rate Provider Fix (2025-09-03)

**‚úÖ FIXED: Direct stKAIA holdings now correctly apply rate provider**

VaultCore's `getTotalAssets()` now properly applies the rate provider (1.0589x) to direct stKAIA holdings, ensuring accurate share pricing for all depositors.

### LP Calculation Logic for Mainnet 6-Token Pool (2025-09-02)

**‚úÖ FINALIZED: LP value calculation correctly handles all tokens in mainnet pool**

The LP calculation logic has been updated to properly handle the 6-token mainnet pool:

**Token Handling:**
- **KoKAIA, GCKAIA, stKLAY**: Use unwrapped amounts only (no rate provider multiplication)
- **stKAIA**: Uses rate provider (0xefBDe60d5402a570DF7CA0d26Ddfedc413260146) for KAIA conversion
- **sKLAY**: Uses rate provider (0x15F6f25fDedf002B02d6E6be410451866Ff5Ac93) for KAIA conversion
- **BPT**: Excluded from value calculation

For detailed implementation, see [LP_CALCULATION_LOGIC.md](./docs/LP_CALCULATION_LOGIC.md)

### Contract Upgrade Scripts with Cache and Library Issues Resolution (2025-09-02)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Enhanced upgrade scripts that handle cache issues and library linking**

#### Background:
After cache issues discovered, comprehensive upgrade scripts were created to handle:
1. **Hardhat upgrades plugin cache issues** - Forces new implementation deployment
2. **Library linking for VaultCore** - LPCalculations library must be deployed and linked
3. **Proxy registration issues** - Direct upgradeToAndCall fallback when proxy not recognized
4. **ClaimManager optimization** - Only redeploys when contract code changes

#### Enhanced Upgrade Scripts:
- **`scripts/upgradeAllFixed.js`** - Upgrades all contracts with comprehensive error handling
- **`scripts/upgradeShareVaultFixed.js`** - Handles cache issues with forced redeployment
- **`scripts/upgradeVaultCoreFixed.js`** - Includes LPCalculations library deployment and linking
- **`scripts/upgradeSwapContractFixed.js`** - Cache-aware upgrade with fallback logic

#### Usage:
```bash
# Clean cache and upgrade all contracts
CLEAN_CACHE=true PROFILE=stable npx hardhat run scripts/upgradeAllFixed.js --network kairos

# Individual upgrades with specific profile
PROFILE=balanced npx hardhat run scripts/upgradeVaultCoreFixed.js --network kaia

# Force cache cleaning before upgrade
rm -rf .openzeppelin cache artifacts/build-info
npx hardhat compile
```

### Key Features & Achievements:
- ‚úÖ Contract size issue resolved with separated architecture
- ‚úÖ All security audit issues fixed (Critical & High risk)
- ‚úÖ Standard ERC4626 pattern implemented
- ‚úÖ WKAIA deposit state sync issue resolved
- ‚úÖ All LST deposits working correctly
- ‚úÖ GIVEN_OUT withdrawals implemented successfully
- ‚úÖ SwapContract handles all 4 LSTs uniformly
- ‚úÖ Integrated tests: 100% success rate
- ‚úÖ Sequential Swap with APY-based ordering
- ‚úÖ Depositor counting feature
- ‚úÖ LP token valuation with LST unwrap conversions
- ‚úÖ Enhanced upgrade scripts with cache handling
- ‚úÖ ClaimManager optimization (only redeploys when needed)
- ‚úÖ Production ready

## Important Configuration Notes

### Current Settings:
- **STABLE**: investRatio = 100% (all to LSTs, no WKAIA buffer)
- **BALANCED**: investRatio = 100%, balancedRatio = 50% (50% LST, 50% LP)
- **Slippage**: 10% default for testnet conditions
- **Withdrawal Fees**: 0.3% (30 basis points)

### Future Considerations:
1. **LP Removal Optimization**: Consider optimizing LP removal to minimize unnecessary removals
2. **Per-Block Limit Review**: Monitor mainnet usage patterns for multi-deposit needs
3. **Slippage Adjustment**: Reduce to 5-10% for mainnet with better liquidity

## Testing

### Quick Test Commands:
```bash
# Test STABLE mode (testnet)
npm run test:stable:testnet

# Test BALANCED mode (testnet)
npm run test:balanced:testnet

# Upgrade with cache handling (testnet)
npm run upgrade:testnet:stable:fixed
npm run upgrade:testnet:balanced:fixed
```
