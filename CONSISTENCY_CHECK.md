## Key Changes from 30% to 90%

| Aspect | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Investment Ratio | 30% | 90% | 3x more capital invested |
| Liquidity Buffer | 70% | 10% | Reduced idle capital |
| User Returns | Lower | Maximized | Better yields for users |
| Withdrawal Threshold | 1.4x | 7.5x | Higher initial liquidity needed |

## Important Notes

1. **User Returns Priority**: 90% investRatio maximizes returns for users as requested
2. **Withdrawal Threshold**: At 90% investment, initial deployments need ~7.5x liquidity buffer for 100% withdrawals
3. **Solution**: Provide initial seed liquidity or reduce investRatio temporarily if issues arise
4. **Approach**: If problems occur at 90%, solve them properly rather than reducing the ratio

## Consistency Status: ✅ VERIFIED

All files are consistent with 90% investRatio configuration.
